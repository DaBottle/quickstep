# Third-Party Libraries

This directory includes various open-source third-party libraries used by
Quickstep. Some have been modified slightly to fix build issues or to integrate
with Quickstep. With the exception of TMB (which is part of the Quickstep
project itself), all libraries here belong to their original authors and are
governed by their respective licenses.
